SpacetimeSailing
================

Java Game created for CIS 120

To run, clone the entire repo; the Pictures folder must be in the same directory 
as the jar file in order for the game to run.

You are in a spaceship orbiting the Earth and need to collect asteroids floating
through the solar system. Your only means of moving are exiting planets' orbits
strategically to go in the desired direction and using a solar sale that
accelerates you away from the sun. Don't run out of energy while free floating,
orbiting planets fuels you up again. Click on HELP for more detailed
instructions and control keys.

Have fun!
